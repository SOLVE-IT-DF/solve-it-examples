# Reorganization of techniques using process models

## Introduction
This example shows how the techniques can be reorganized using a different configuration file ([solve-it.json](https://github.com/SOLVE-IT-DF/solve-it/blob/main/data/solve-it.json) is the standard organization).

The files:

[carrier.json](carrier.json)
[dfrws.json](dfrws.json)

can be used to organize the techniques according to those process models. 


## Using those models
