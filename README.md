# A series of examples making use of the SOLVE-IT knowledge base

## Forensic workflow example: forensic Imaging
Forensic imaging is often defined as a single process. However, when mapped against SOLVE-IT technqiues it reveals a series of technqiues are used. This example shows how to compile the techniques used for a process and examine the weaknesses and the extent to which they are mitigated within an implementation of the workflow. 
See full example [here](https://github.com/chrishargreaves/solve-it-examples/tree/main/forensic_workflow_example_forensic_imaging).

## Dependencies in digital forensic tools
This (in progress) example will illustrate how techniques can have dependencies and how that means that some weaknesses in one technique can cause weaknesses in others. 

## Subtleties in mitigation approaches: a file system example
This example illustrates how mitigations that are sometimes used interchangably are not, and how they need to be selected and used carefully in specific circumstances. 

## Mapping of techniques: a drone forensics example
This example illustrates how a domain within digital forensics can be taken, and the knowledge based used to isolate the technqiues used within that area.
